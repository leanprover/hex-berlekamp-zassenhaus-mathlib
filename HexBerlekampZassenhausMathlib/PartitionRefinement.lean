Support-partition counting for the BHKS class-count lower bound.

When a family of nonempty supports genuinely partitions the factor indices,
the support-equivalence partition has exactly one class per support.

/-! # Support-partition length from a genuine partition

The B8 partition-refinement hypothesis `hpartition` consumed by the fast recovery
irreducibility wrappers is an equality
`(supportPartitionByMinColumn trueSupports).length = normalizedFactors.card`.
The lemma below supplies the extension-agnostic combinatorial half of that
discharge: when `trueSupports` is a genuine partition of `Fin r` into nonempty
parts (each column lies in exactly one part), the support-equivalence partition
has exactly one class per part, so its length is the number of parts.  A
`trueSupports`-builder pairs this with a bijection from the parts to
`normalizedFactors (toPolynomial core)`. -/
