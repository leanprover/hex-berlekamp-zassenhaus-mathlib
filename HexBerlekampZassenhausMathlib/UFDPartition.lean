Abstract UFD partition-cardinality bound used by the BHKS Group B
certification chain.

The Mathlib-side layer needs to convert "the algorithm returned a list of
non-unit divisors that multiply back to `f`" into "each divisor is
irreducible." The
UFD half of that argument is independent of the BHKS lattice machinery: in any
unique factorization monoid, if `gs.length = (normalizedFactors f).card` then
each `g ∈ gs` accounts for exactly one irreducible factor of `f`, hence is
irreducible.

This module isolates the Mathlib UFD reasoning so the algorithm-specific work
(certifying the cardinality equality from BHKS lattice success state) can be
treated separately.

Upper cardinality bound for a product partition in a UFD.

If a non-zero element `f` is associated to the product of a list of non-zero
non-unit factors, then that list cannot have more entries than the multiset of
normalized irreducible factors of `f`. Each list entry contributes at least one
normalized factor. The bound requires product preservation and
`shouldRecord`/non-unit facts, but does not assume irreducibility of the
emitted factors.

If a list of irreducible factors has product associated to `f`, then the

This is the converse cardinality direction to
{name}`length_le_normalizedFactors_card` for the already-certified irreducible
partition case. It is kept as the exact equality form because the exported

Lower cardinality bound for a coverage-style square-free partition.

When `f` is square-free and every irreducible factor of `f` is associated to
some emitted entry in `gs`, the emitted list has at least as many entries as
`f` has normalized irreducible factors.  Combined with
{name}`length_le_normalizedFactors_card`, this gives the cardinality equality
needed by `irreducible_of_partition_card_eq_normalizedFactors_card`.

Distinct normalized factors of a square-free `f` cannot share an emitted
witness (associated normalized elements are equal), so the witness map is
injective and the image cardinality bounds the list length. -/

The normalized factors of a list product of irreducibles are exactly the
normalizations of the list entries, viewed as a multiset.

Use this when a uniqueness or scalar-splitting proof needs to replace the
abstract UFD factor multiset of a certified product by the concrete flattened
list of factors.

Uniqueness for scalar-prefixed products of flattened monic irreducible integer
polynomial factors.

If two nonzero integer scalars multiply products of monic irreducible factors
to the same polynomial, the scalars agree and the flattened products have the
same normalized-factor multiset. This is the Mathlib/UFD result needed by the
factorization uniqueness theorem after executable factor entries have been
expanded by multiplicity. The theorem stays public as the clean monic
specialization; current BZ factorization uniqueness uses the normalize-fixed
variant below because executable factors are not necessarily monic.

Variant of `scalar_eq_and_normalizedFactors_eq_of_monic_irreducible_product_eq`
for nonconstant {name}`normalize`-fixed irreducible integer polynomial factors, which
is what the BZ uniqueness theorem actually has (the executable
`normalizeFactorSign` only enforces a nonnegative leading coefficient, not a
unit leading coefficient).

If two nonzero integer scalars multiply products of nonconstant {name}`normalize`-fixed
irreducible integer polynomial factors to the same polynomial, the scalars
agree and the flattened factor lists agree as multisets. Constant factors are
ruled out by the `natDegree ≠ 0` hypothesis, so they cannot leak between the
scalar prefix and the factor list. This is the exported shape used by
`Factorization` uniqueness after translating executable factors to
`Polynomial ℤ`.

**Group B partition-cardinality bound (Mathlib-only UFD argument).**

In any unique factorization monoid, a non-zero element `f` admitting a list of
non-unit divisors `gs` whose product is associated to `f` and whose length
equals the cardinality of `normalizedFactors f` must consist entirely of
irreducible elements.

This isolates the UFD half of the BHKS Group B / B8 certification theorem:
the algorithm-specific work (establishing the cardinality equality from BHKS
lattice success state) is handled separately and supplies the `hcount`
hypothesis to this lemma. Fast and exhaustive branch lemmas should use this
once they have product preservation, non-unit entries, and the final count
equality.

**UFD subset-factor lemma.**

In a unique factorization monoid, if a non-zero element `g` divides the
product of a multiset of irreducibles `qs`, then the normalized factorization
of `g` is a sub-multiset of `qs` up to normalization.

This is the UFD half of the BZ certificate degree-obstruction argument:
once an integer factor reduces to a divisor of the recorded modular factor
product, its modular factorization is drawn from the recorded irreducibles.
The polynomial degree lemma below is the usual public caller-facing package;
this theorem remains available for callers that need the raw sub-multiset
relation.

**UFD subset existence and uniqueness for squarefree-product divisors.**

In a unique factorization monoid, if `factors` is a `Nodup` multiset of
normalize-fixed irreducibles and `d` is a normalize-fixed divisor of
`factors.prod`, then there is a unique sub-multiset `S ≤ factors` whose
product equals `d`. The witness is `normalizedFactors d`; uniqueness uses
{name}`normalizedFactors_prod_eq` to recover any candidate from its product.

This is the abstract Mathlib half of the
`existsUnique_modPFactorSubset_of_choosePrimeData` assembly: the final
caller instantiates `α := Polynomial (ZMod p)` and transports the
resulting sub-multiset through an executable factor-list indexing.

**Polynomial subset-degree lemma.**

Over a field `K`, if `g : K[X]` is non-zero and divides the product of a
multiset of irreducible polynomials `qs`, then `g.natDegree` is the sum of
some sub-multiset of `qs.map natDegree`.

This is the degree-subset-sum packaging of
{name}`normalizedFactors_le_map_normalize_of_dvd_prod_irreducibles` that the BZ
certificate degree-obstruction caller needs: the recorded modular factor
degrees are the `qs.map natDegree` values, and the contradiction with a
"no subset sums to `g.natDegree`" obstruction comes from this lemma.
